# Bag of Words Project Repository

Welcome to the Bag of Words Project Repository! This repository contains scripts to preprocess text data, store unique words, and create a bag-of-words representation along with word frequency counts using Python and NLTK.

## Project Descriptions

### Store Unique Words
- **Script**: `Bag_of_words_FILE.ipynb`
- **Description**: This script preprocesses a text file by tokenizing the content, converting all words to lowercase, and removing punctuation and stopwords. It then stores the unique words from the text in a separate output file. This process ensures that only the significant words are kept, which can be useful for further text analysis or NLP tasks.

### Display Word Frequency
- **Script**: `Bag_of_words_COUNT.ipynb`
- **Description**: This script reads a text file, creates a bag-of-words representation of the text, and displays the frequency of each word in the text. By using a tokenizer, it converts the text into a sequence of word indices and calculates how many times each word appears in the text. This is useful for understanding the distribution and importance of words in the dataset.
